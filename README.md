# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview
For this analysis, Amazing Prime tasked us with creating an automated pipeline that:
  1. Takes in new data
  2. Performs the appropriate transformations
  3. Loads the data into existing tables
We just needed to refactor the code from the modules in order to complete this challenge.
